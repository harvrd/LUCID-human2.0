 Testing.  Hello. Hello. Is it recording. Yes. Now you will be given information blocks on which to base your answers. To complete a series of questions such as problem solving. Analytical thinking, logical reasoning and relevant use of asset formation. So your thoughts. You're presented with a scenario in which a group of hikers is lost in a remote area with limited. Have a map encompass the no GPS or other electronic devices. The group consists of four people with varying levels of hiking experience. What steps should the group take to try to find their way back to civilization. Okay, let me think. So it seems they're in a remote area without electronic devices. And they have varying degrees of experience. So I guess I would say the first step is to. Once they realize this, assess their surroundings. Try to identify any familiar landmarks. And try to Orient themselves using the sun and moon, and then they should also try to backtrack along their previous route. Just look for any signs or symbols. That they could find their way back from. They should also use any available compasses or navigational tools they have if they do to Orient themselves. And if the hikers are really completely lost and unable to backtrack, they should create a makeshift shelter and conserve their food and water until they can be rescued or find their way back. How would you prioritize the group's needs given their limited supplies. I think they should prioritize. First. Like water and shelters. Those are the two things. Basically like you want to use water sparingly until you find like a reliable source anywhere. You should also build a shelter if you know that. This will. Like it's. It's not optimistic that you would find your way back or if they've already exhausted all their paths back and they can't find it. They should build a shelter so that they can conserve energy at night. And they should ration their food a lot and possibly hunting or fishing or finding edible plants. If anyone knows about those kinds of things. And then locate a high point and maybe signal for rescue if anyone knows, but Yeah. What factors should the group consider when deciding which directions head in.  Let me think. So I guess. Familiar landmarks. Anything that they saw along the way or anything. If they have a map, they could know about an ocean or a cliff or some famous mountain or something. They should use the sun and Moon and. They should backtrack so because they walk through. Because they went through this path, they could probably find their way back by seeing all the nature spots that they pass through. And. To Orient themselves. If they have a compass or a map that would help us. How might the group signal for help if they are unable to find their way back on their own.  If they're unable to. Find the way back on their own. Then. The signal for help. They should locate a high point. And create a very visible signal for planes or trucks going by. They can also use reflective surfaces or if they have a whistle or anyone knows how to make a fire. Fire is very important. What skills or knowledge would be particularly useful in this situation.  Some skills or knowledge that would be useful.  Let me think. Just knowledge of basic wilderness survival like plants and food. First aid skills. Fire making skills navigational skills like sunroof and stars. Ability to Hunt or fish for food. And familiarity with the area. How would you address any conflicts or disagreements that arise within the group during the search.   When. They're finding conflicts or anything. I think they should obviously establish very clear communication rules and ensure that everyone feels heard and valued. And address conflicts as they arise immediately. And encourage open dialogue to find solutions that work for everyone. Prioritize safety and well being of the group over personal opinions or desires. And encourage teamwork. And collaboration. And assign specific roles and responsibilities to each Member to ensure everyone has a clear purpose. Okay. Thank you. You've completed the task. Thank you.  Why would you.
