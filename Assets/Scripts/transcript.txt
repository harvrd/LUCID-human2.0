You are given the following information about scientific studies. A research team conducted a study to investigate the effects of sleep on memory consolidation. They recruited participants who were given a list of words to memorize before they went to bed. The following day, the participants were tested on their ability to recall the words. What are some limitations of the study design.  Let me think. One thing could be like the limited sample size, so it could be like the study may not have had a large enough sample size to really represent the whole population. And then second could be like lack of control. They could have not had good controls in place. It can't for other factors like confounding factors and things like that. The study may not have been long enough to fully explore the effects of sleep on memory. That's one other thing. It could also have a limited scope. So they only really investigate the effects of sleep on memory consolidation. And did not explore other factors that could impact memory retention and things like that. And then finally. Possible biases. The researchers conducting the study. May have had some preconceived notions about the expected outcome, and if they didn't double blind or whatever, maybe. It could have been a little biased. How would you interpret the study's findings.   What do you mean by that? I'm kind of confused. Could you? How would you interpret the study findings? How would you interpret. What they discovered from the research. What methods would I use.  Just like how would you interpret the research. But how would I interpret it if I don't know any of the results. No. It's more. Like. What do they mean in a broader context, kind of. What would the results of a study like this mean.  Yeah. I guess you can say like 1 minute. If you want to differ that way. Yeah. What methods would you use to interpret.  I guess it could be important for understanding how sleep affects memory. And potentially developing interventions. So improved memory consolidation during sleep. And that has wide ranging effects for the entire population of the human race. Basically. And I guess that's something you could interpret. What are some potential implications of a study findings for future reasons. For future research.   For future research.   Future research.  Oh, my God. This is wrong. Okay, future research could really explore other factors that might impact memory retention. Take into account different populations and use more rigorous controls to minimize biases.  Wait click on the terminal. Well. That's it. Okay.  Well, no, I mean like the ones I asked you. I asked you the previous one. Yeah. Okay. I think we got some good. Do you think it's good enough. Who are you? Recording? Yeah. Fucking around. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Wait. Okay. The pump is fucked up a little bit. Fact checking is kind of ass. Well, okay. We should change one of the scenario like a few of the scenarios such that. We get. Some thing that is heavy on fact checking. We can't change the questionnaire because we have to get our group agreement. You can if it's. Like not. Like a significant change. They don't want to hear it basically. But we can email them to update them just to let them know. But I think. Yeah. I mean, it's up to us, I guess. Okay, let me try to get the video. We didn't work on the specific. Prompt and questions. Basically after this. Yeah, but we have a good demo now. I was well. Wait. Does that mean I got your ladder? Your loud ass fucking season. Yeah. Why do you sleep like that. To piss you off.  Dude, wait, this is so good. Wait. We. Executed.  You're right. Yay. Holy shit. I'm going to pass. Dude, don't pass out, bro. I'm going to pass out. Holy shit. When have they ripped. Insufficient. This space. Holy fuck. Delete some shit. Let's just delete this six gigabyte file. Here. The 17 gigabyte file. Holy fuck. Oh, my God. 20gb. Oh my God. So why you can't have nice things. Do not save. No. It did save. I just can't transfer it to computers. Okay. Let this shit download. I can't believe you're actually plenty of.  My skateboard? No, that's two couple.  Why the hell are we like this. Fuck it. Was wrong.  It's the physical attraction. I think it is actually. I think that's like the main problem. Is nobody physical attraction. But it's over now. We're all chilling. Can you hear me about. Yeah, it's so weird.
